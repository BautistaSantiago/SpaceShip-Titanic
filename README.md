# Spaceship-Titanic
Data Science Project where our team does research on a given project in this case, predicting who and how many people survived the space incident. Integrated countless supervised machine-learning algorithms and add-ons to ensure the most accurate result possible. To use these types of algorithms our team used transformed CSV files from excel files.
This project was done on Jupyter and Google Collab. Parts done by Santiago Bautista was all initial classifiers with Cross-Validation.
